* How can we define the core
* How do you want to define 'core' for questions in your BRC
* What do you think the abundance / prevalence curve looks like for our BRC soils
* Does this change if we think about different crops - poplar, sorhum, miscanthus, switchgrass
* Where do you think our isolates would overlay on this figure?
* What are the limitations of identifying a core

Ideas from Group Brainstorm
* Definition of core and change of that core
* Ideas of the shape of the prev/abundance curve - are there a group of microbes that trascend different datasets
* Prevalence >> Abundance
* But there has to be an abundance that is detectable (Sequencing limitations)
* The effects of adding more (and more diverse or similar) samples (tend to reduce)
* Filtering is so very dependent on the question and scope
* Do we care "universal"?
* Being part of the core  may not be meaningful or beneficial
* Indirect beneficial will be difficult to measure with "core" approaches
* Overlaying 'culturing' on the sequencing
